            English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most
            influential
            men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to
            be the most
            influential book in the history of science. <br><br> <div class="link">

            Einstein, a German physicist, is best known for
            his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2.
            Einstein received
            the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery
            of the law of
            the photoelectric effect. <br><br>

            <i>“The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think
            clearly, but one can think deeply
            and be quite insane.”</i> <br><br><br> Tesla was a Serbian engineer and inventor who is often described
            as the most important scientist
            and inventor of the modern age, man who “shed light over the face of Earth”. He is best known for many
            revolutionary
            contributions in the field of electricity and magnetism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <br><br>
